# [FLASH](https://sites.google.com/view/digitaldivision/home)
Flash is a first-person horror game made for a school project using Pygame and preinstalled python libraries. You awaken in a maze, armed with only a flashlight, scouring for a key to escape the darkness. As you search, you find you may not be alone...

## Features
**FIRST-PERSON**
A custom raycasting engine provides a three-dimensional experience, immersing the user in the objective of the game.


**EVOCATIVE HAND DRAWN ART & CUSTOM AUDIO**
Every detail was taken into account before it was implemented in the game. This includes unique art and audio, both only using a handful of instruments to provide a variety of experiences.


**RANDOM MAP GENERATION**
The map is randomly generated using an in-built algorithm that changes the position of items and walls, making a new experience everytime you play the game.


**RECORDED STATS**
Every run-through of the game is recorded in a text file in the game, Allowing you to compete against yourself or others playing the game with you


**ENEMY AI & CUSTOM DIFFICULTY**
The main enemy of the game takes several actions to stop you. You must take different actions in response to the enemy's movements to avoid losing the game. The corresponding action to take can be found in the help menu in-game 


**CUSTOM SETTINGS**
The game also features custom settings, including controls, graphics, and whether the game will be played in fullscreen or not. You can also select how detailed you want the graphics for the game to be. **NOTE: Choosing a graphic setting that is too demanding could cause errors when running the game, so choose a setting appropriate for your hardware.**


You can play the game by downloading all the files in a directory and running the FLASH_main.py file (make sure you have Pygame!).
